## Project Name: **ZoraMuse – The AI-Powered Creator Coach & Trader Companion**

---

### 💡 Idea Overview:

**ZoraMuse** is an AI-powered web and mobile mini-app that helps creators **optimize their content for tokenization**, and helps traders **identify and track high-potential content coins** — all while deeply integrating the **Zora Coins SDK** and monetization features.

### 🔧 Key Features:

#### 🧑‍🎨 For Creators:
1. **$Ticker Genius (AI Ticker + Caption Assistant)**  
   Uses AI (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, or local LLMs) to:
   - Recommend $ticker names based on your image/video and current Zora/Base trends.
   - Suggest catchy captions that improve trading potential.
   - Analyze metadata and predict engagement potential.

2. **Value Prediction Engine**  
   - Trained on historical Zora coin performance.
   - Estimates trading volume, volatility, and monetization potential based on your content.

3. **One-Click Post & Coin**  
   - Seamless SDK integration: upload → analyze → suggest → post → coin, all from one interface.

#### 😎 For Traders:
4. **Alpha Feed (AI-curated trending coins)**  
   - Real-time surfacing of surging coins with insights ("$ARTDOG is trending due to Farcaster buzz").
   - Sentiment analysis from comments and captions using NLP.

5. **Portfolio Advisor**  
   - Recommends actions (buy/hold/sell) based on coin volatility and trader profile.
   - Tracks referral earnings from trading & creator support.

6. **Telegram + Farcaster Bots**  
   - Real-time alerts on trending or AI-predicted coins.
   - “Buy this coin now” links integrated for fast trades.
